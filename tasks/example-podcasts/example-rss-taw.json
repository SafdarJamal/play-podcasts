But history, science and experience all suggests it’s not the most far fetched of theories.</p>\n<p>Will the coulda, woulda, shoulda ever go away around these ghost games? Will the abnormal ever become more normal? And will the shame of football without fans ever not be felt?</p>\n<p>When &#8211; and it looks almost certainly to be a case of when &#8211; Premier League football returns and Liverpool play once more, only without fans and behind closed doors, we’ll know more.</p>\n<p>Yes, it’s 11 skilled athletes versus 11 skilled athletes on a rectangle of grass.

I can’t be the only one constantly conflicted over it all. Spain manager Luis Enrique said this week: “Playing without fans is sadder than dancing with your sister”. It undoubtedly feels a bit wrong however it is sold and packaged.</p>\n<p>I also can’t be the only one who has found much of the debate around the &#8216;what next&#8217; for football to be just as grim. Rabid self interest has raged in the near-public discussions, initially veiled but now on show for all to see &#8211; and no longer covered up by the daily exhilaration of the game itself, and everything that surrounds it.</p>\n<p>Initially it was Karren Brady who walked into the sunlight first before skulking back into the shadows. Now it’s not just West Ham. It’s Watford, Brighton, Aston Villa and more. It’s everywhere. At every turn.

Is it the one we thought it was? Did we only skim read it? And does it now need to be rewritten?

That includes clubs from the biggest to the smallest. From the top to the bottom.</p>\n<p>To glance back at the German picture, we can get misty eyed about the 50+1 rule which gives members (fans) a perpetual veto on magpie owners with values different from those of supporters. The rule is a great idea, and something that should be looked at over here, along with legislation to give the current ‘fit and proper person’ tests some real teeth.</p>\n<p>But money has reared its ugly head there just as it has here and supporters have highlighted its malignant influence on many occasions.</p>\n<p>However, where there seems to be a difference right now &#8211; at least when it comes to glancing over from this bit of land to that bit of land &#8211; is the spirit of the collective among the clubs.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-70565\" src=\"https://www.theanfieldwrap.com/uploads/2020/05/22338653291_eaf4e77b2e_b.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://www.theanfieldwrap.com/uploads/2020/05/22338653291_eaf4e77b2e_b.jpg 1024w, https://www.theanfieldwrap.com/uploads/2020/05/22338653291_eaf4e77b2e_b-980x735.jpg 980w, https://www.theanfieldwrap.com/uploads/2020/05/22338653291_eaf4e77b2e_b-480x360.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1024px, 100vw\" /></p>\n<p>Plenty of German supporter groups have opposed the league’s decision to host “ghost games” but when the hole left by reneging on TV and sponsorship deals is presented &#8211; alongside the fact that clubs could go the wall as a consequence &#8211; the idea became more palatable, plans were made, plans were approved and balls were kicked once again.</p>\n<p>Are we there yet over here? It doesn’t look like, does it? Anonymous briefings to newspapers continue. An air of mistrust snakes around it all, with concerns even appearing in the media (anonymously, of course) that clubs could fake a Coronavirus crisis to seek an advantage.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, leadership and communication still seems to leave a lot to be desired. Where the Government leads, football follows, it seems.</p>\n<p>Anyway, on we go.</p>\n<p>Next for Union Berlin it’s a short trip to Hertha Berlin for a capital city derby. It&#8217;s tonight. Friday night. Under the lights. Sounds good, in theory. Imagine the scenes. The vibe. That palpable feeling that hangs in the air that you can almost reach out and touch.</p>\n<p>But with no fans. Without all that. No colour. No sounds. Ah. It’s a shame.</p>\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-left\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http://bundesliga-diaries.com/podcast/\">Click here</a></span> to give the Bundesliga Diaries podcast a listen and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://www.theanfieldwrap.com/taw_subscribe.php\">subscribe</a></span> for more TAW Bundesliga coverage&#8230; </h2>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-partner=\"tweetdeck\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">&quot;You must be able to take some pleasure from seeing a skill, an art, a game that you have followed all of your life being performed to that level.&quot;<br><br>&quot;In order to get the football you like back, we have to have this football.&quot;<br><br>Subscribe to listen in full <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f449.png\" alt=\"👉\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /><a href=\"https://t.co/oaOWcUzrlr\">https://t.co/oaOWcUzrlr</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/bjxm22JWUs\">pic.twitter.com/bjxm22JWUs</a></p>&mdash; The Anfield Wrap (@TheAnfieldWrap) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheAnfieldWrap/status/1263421675338641410?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 21, 2020</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\n\n\n<p></p>",

The rule is a great idea, and something that should be looked at over here, along with legislation to give the current ‘fit and proper person’ tests some real teeth.</p>\n<p>But money has reared its ugly head there just as it has here and supporters have highlighted its malignant influence on many occasions.</p>\n<p>However, where there seems to be a difference right now &#8211; at least when it comes to glancing over from this bit of land to that bit of land &#8211; is the spirit of the collective among the clubs.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-70565\" src=\"https://www.theanfieldwrap.com/uploads/2020/05/22338653291_eaf4e77b2e_b.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://www.theanfieldwrap.com/uploads/2020/05/22338653291_eaf4e77b2e_b.jpg 1024w, https://www.theanfieldwrap.com/uploads/2020/05/22338653291_eaf4e77b2e_b-980x735.jpg 980w, https://www.theanfieldwrap.com/uploads/2020/05/22338653291_eaf4e77b2e_b-480x360.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1024px, 100vw\" /></p>\n<p>Plenty of German supporter groups have opposed the league’s decision to host “ghost games” but when the hole left by reneging on TV and sponsorship deals is presented &#8211; alongside the fact that clubs could go the wall as a consequence &#8211; the idea became more palatable, plans were made, plans were approved and balls were kicked once again.</p>\n<p>Are we there yet over here? It doesn’t look like, does it? Anonymous briefings to newspapers continue. An air of mistrust snakes around it all, with concerns even appearing in the media (anonymously, of course) that clubs could fake a Coronavirus crisis to seek an advantage.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, leadership and communication still seems to leave a lot to be desired. Where the Government leads, football follows, it seems.</p>\n<p>Anyway, on we go.</p>\n<p>Next for Union Berlin it’s a short trip to Hertha Berlin for a capital city derby. It&#8217;s tonight. Friday night. Under the lights. Sounds good, in theory. Imagine the scenes. The vibe. That palpable feeling that hangs in the air that you can almost reach out and touch.</p>\n<p>But with no fans. Without all that. No colour. No sounds. Ah. It’s a shame.</p>\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-left\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http://bundesliga-diaries.com/podcast/\">Click here</a></span> to give the Bundesliga Diaries podcast a listen and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://www.theanfieldwrap.com/taw_subscribe.php\">subscribe</a></span> for more TAW Bundesliga coverage&#8230; </h2>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-partner=\"tweetdeck\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">&quot;You must be able to take some pleasure from seeing a skill, an art, a game that you have followed all of your life being performed to that level.&quot;<br><br>&quot;In order to get the football you like back, we have to have this football.&quot;<br><br>Subscribe to listen in full <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f449.png\" alt=\"👉\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /><a href=\"https://t.co/oaOWcUzrlr\">https://t.co/oaOWcUzrlr</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/bjxm22JWUs\">pic.twitter.com/bjxm22JWUs</a></p>&mdash; The Anfield Wrap (@TheAnfieldWrap) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheAnfieldWrap/status/1263421675338641410?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 21, 2020</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\n\n\n<p></p>"
